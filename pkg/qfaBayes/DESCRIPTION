Description: A set of tools and workflows for modelling the growth dynamics of colonies arrayed on plates, as well as performing quantitative fitness analysis (QFA) on distinct (usually genetically) types of colonies. Frequent colony growth observations are required in a specific R data.frame format. qfa can use image logs generated by Colonyzer (http://research.ncl.ac.uk/colonyzer/). You can pre-process these data with our Robot Object Database (ROD: http://sourceforge.net/projects/robotobjectdb/). The model is fit either using maximum likelihood (fast), or using a hierarchical Bayesian model for all of the colonies in an experimental unit (CPU intensive). The Bayesian fit is performed using Gibbs Sampling, as implemented by JAGS in the package rjags. With appropriately designed experiments, qfa can also estimate genetic interaction strengths and produce epistasis plots.
