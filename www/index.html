<h2>qfa: A set of tools for carrying out Quantitative Fitness Analysis</h2> 

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p> In the qfa method, we generate cell density timecourse estimates by repeatedly photographing micro-organism cultures growing in arrays on
solid agar plates.  We quantify cell density using the image analysis tool <a href="http://research.ncl.ac.uk/colonyzer">Colonyzer</a>
(<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-11-287">Lawless et al., 2010</a>).
We fit a logistic model to each timecourse for each independently growing culture, and use the logistic model parameters
to define a quantitative measure of culture fitness.</p>

<h3>Applications</h3>

<p>If the arrayed cultures contain relevant genetic mutations, we can use fitness estimates
to infer the presence or absence of epistasis, and quantify genetic interaction strengths.
If the arrayed cultures are grown at selected temperatures we can infer the extent of temperature sensitivity of mutants.
We have described both of the above applications in <a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/doi/pgen.1001362">Addinall et al., 2011</a>.
If cultures are subject to treatments (e.g. nutrition, or drug treatments) we can generate ranked lists of mutations affected by 
the treatment.
